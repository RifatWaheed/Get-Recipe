## Description:
    webApp for food recipe using React,Context API,CSS and fetched data from The Meal DB.

### Getting Started
    -Build the components
      1. Favorits.jsx
      2. Meals.jsx
      3. Modal.jsx
      4. Search.jsx

### Associate Context API
    made the 2 components 
    -AppProvider
    -AppContext
    passed the special prop "children"

### Create a custom hook so we don't have to export and import two contexts or more  
    in this case AppContext and useContext were needed to import in the Meals component
    we just have to create a custom hook and import it with destructuring it. It's a good 
    practice when we have more and more contexts we need to import , saves atleast 
    1 line of code for each added context

    -In context.jsx created a custom hook named useGolabalContext
    - export const useGlobalContext = () =>{
      return useContext(AppContext)
    }
### Modified the components accordingly
    with the help of context api we could build the bridges among the components passing data through them
    so the rest of the application was pretty much the use States and repitation of similar work and styling css.
